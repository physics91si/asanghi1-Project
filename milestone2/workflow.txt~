What does your project accomplish?
I am designing a genome aligner. The genome has four possible bases at each position, a,g,t, or c. In the  era of next-generation sequencing, we are able to profile the sequence of the genome. Sequencing generates a dataset of short,70 base pair reads throughout the genome. I will model this process, and using these sequencing reads, I will determinee the full sequence of the genome. To determine the sequence, I will find overlapion regions in the reads and use that to order the reads. This concept is called de novo alignment. 
● What inputs will it accept? Explain how the program will interact with the user and with any data it
needs. In what format will the data be initially? What commands or options does the user need to
provide? In what Python data structures will you store data and user input? 
● What manipulations will the program perform on the data? Explain how you’ll manipulate the data
and user input. Explain how you’ll use scientific Python functionality that you’ve learned towards the
manipulations. 
● What outputs will the program produce? Explain how the program will give output to the user: plots,
statistics, more data, etc. Don’t go into too much depth on this part; we’ll spend more time later on
making readable, useful output
